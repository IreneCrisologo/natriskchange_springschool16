Research Topic
--------------
######Using the Philippine Radar Network in enhancing the Early Warning System and Rainfall Forecasting

The research focuses on improving the rainfall estimates from the newly-developed network of ground weather radars in the Philippines and using the data to leverage on improving the early warning system in the country. In particular, the main objectives are:


1. To combine different weather radar data into composite images giving the best rainfall estimate and coverage for the overlapping regions
2. To determine the practicality of using TRMM satellite measurements in calibrating weather radars on the ground
3. To use radar rainfall estimates in driving a hydrological model for the Pampanga River Basin

Data Types and Sources
------------
1. Radar Data
	* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) [[http://www.repo.pscigrid.gov.ph/radar]](http://www.repo.pscigrid.gov.ph/radar)
2. Gauge Data
	* DOST Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) [[http://www.repo.pscigrid.gov.ph/predict]](http://www.repo.pscigrid.gov.ph/predict)
3. Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM)

Methods
-------
The main tool for processing the radar data is __wradlib__ [1]
